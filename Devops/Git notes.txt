version countrol system

VCS means it is a system where number are codes are kept in this mission and ever one can acces the others code

the VCS performs three types

1.it will collect all the codes and make into single code

2.it will show the how is uploading and modifing with date and time

3.it will keep the old file we upload and new files also

there are two types of VCS
1. Centralised- directly uploaded into remote repository

2. Distributed- first uploaded into local repository after all the code is ok the remote repository 

 for using folder or opening the folder in git "cd path" we will go into that folder
BUt when the git commands to work with that folder "git init" we can now use the git commands to that folder

The code which is stored in folder is called as the 

Working space ---> stagging area ---> loacal Repository

  "                     "                  "
untracked file     Indexed Files       commited Files

When we want to send untracked files to indexed file "git add filename"

To send all untracked files to indexed file "git add . "

To undo the files from indexed files to untracked file "git rm --cached filename"

To send the all indexed files to commited files "git commit -m filename or folder name"

To see the commited files "git Log"

when we have a personal data we dont want to send that data to local repository than we can send all tha file to new file ".gitignore" git will never touch this files
