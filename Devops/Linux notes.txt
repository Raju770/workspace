                              LINUX 

"whoami" to know the user
"exit" to logout
"pwd" present working directory
"touch" to create a file
"ls" list of file 
"cat filename"                to show the data in file
"cat > filename"              to store the data in file
"cat >> filename"             to edit the data in file
                              
                           Directory

directory is the kind of folder
"cat"             used for files 
"mkdir"           used for folder

"mkdir filename"            used to create the folder
"cd filename"               to edit or to create the file in the specified folder
"cd.. "                     to exit the folder
"cd"                        used for the exit from folder
"rm filename"               to delete the file 
"rm -r filename"            to delete the directory
"ls -a" and "ls -a -l"      to see the list of hidden and an visible files
"ls -lah"                   shows all the list with human reding format

                              Link

There two types of links 1. soft link
                         2. hard link

1.for soft link when the main file is deleted the link file also deleted and usless
2.for hard link when we main file delete still the file can be used

"ln -s filename filename (which file we want to link)" this will link(soft) the files
"ln filename filename" if we delete the main file also the link file sill existes

                             TEXT PROCESSING TOOLS

"head filename" will show the first 10 link of the file
"head -(how many lines u need) filename" shows how many lines we requred
"tail filename" it will show last 10 lines of the file
"tail -(how many lines u need) filename" shows how many lines we requred

                                GREEP

"greep word we want filename" it will show the word we need in the file
"greep -(?)word we want filename;
                               -i = iggore the cases
                               -n = show the line number of the word
                               -v = revise word
"wc" word count it well show links,words,character 
"sort filename" well arrange the data in the short manner 
"sort -n filename" well sort the date in numarical wise  
                     
                                 redirection

">"               redirection is the command which send the error data into file
">"               output redirection whe we get any out if character we need use this  
"2>"              if we want to store the error data into file we use this
"&>"              if we dont know wether it is output or error if we need to use this

                                        PIPING

"|" symbel of piping
for using two commands on one command | piping is used
EX 
1. if there is a data of 30 link we need 6-15 lines data
"head -15 filename | tail -10" 
2. if need the word from the file
""head -15 filename | tail -10 | word" 

This piping (|) can do lot of commands in one command

IF the first charatar start with "-" regular file
                                 "d" directory
                                 "l" soft link file


                                    PERMISSIONS

-rwe-rw-r-- file three rwe is ower permission
            secound thee rw- is group permissions
            third r-- is others permissions
To modife this permissions "chmod"

TO CHANGE THE PERMISSIONS there are two types 1. number format
                                              2. alphabet format
          
                                Number format 

Read-4 (r)
write-2 (w)
execute-1 (x)

To change the permission of the file use the above numbers 4,2,1
EX. "chmod 735 filename" well look the file permission like this {rwx-wxr-x}

 1.To see the linux structure like {c drive D drive} "df -h"
 2.To see the storeage in linux "free -m"
 3.To see check the processes running "ps"
 4.To see the backgood running processes "ps -ef"
 5.To look this processes with nice heading "top"
        
                                         USER PERMISSIONS

when ever we give create a new user that automaticaly creat a group
To creat a new user "sudo useradd name"
To set a password for that "sudo passwd name"

                                  OS IS HAVING TWO THINGS 1. KERNEL
                                                          2. SHELL

TO SEE THE SHELLS "vim /etc/shells"

MAIN POINT TO COME OUT FROM ANY COMMAND ":q!"

To creat the Groups
"sudo groupadd filename"

TO check the group information
"sudo vim /etc/group"

To changw the ownership of the file
"sudo chown owershipname filename"
